      <h2>Product and Business</h2>
      <h3>Product videos</h3>
      <p>Product videos have become a staple in the marketing world. They are a great way to showcase your product in a way that is engaging and informative. the 15-30 second videos are perfect for targeted ads and in store displays. The longer 1-3 minute videos go well on landing pages and can be used as tutorials. When it comes to driving a sale, a good product video can make all the difference. Short form video is, and will continue to be the dominant form of media for the foreseeable future. I have worked with some of the best in the industry (Full Time Filmmakers) on product videos.</p>

      <h3>Brand Message Videos</h3>
      <p>Brand message videos are a great way to tell your customers who you are and what you stand for. They are a great way to connect with your customers on a personal level. Statistics show that customers are more likely to buy from a company that they feel a personal connection with. When it comes to building a connection, brand message videos are the starting point.

      <h3>Testimonials And Other Business Video</h3>
      <p>Testimonials are a great way to show potential customers that you are a trustworthy company. They work especially well when it comes to local businesses, or products that are expensive and require a lot of trust. Aside from testimonials, I also offer other business videos such as training videos, and event videos. Any text on a website can be accompanied by a video, and it will always be more engaging. Another great way to build trust and community around a business. There is a fine line to walk between relating to your customers and just being "corporate cringe." I have your best interest in mind and will be the first one to tell you if a video is "cringe" and shouldnt be posted. Find out from me rather than from your comment section.</p>
