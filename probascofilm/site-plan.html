        [Intro:]<br>
        My name is Corbin Probasco, I am a videographer who specializes in outdoor videography.
        I have a passion for capturing the beauty of the outdoors and the people who enjoy it. 
        I have experience in filming weddings, product videos, and business/social media videos. I am based in Utah/Idaho and am available for travel.
        With real work expirence in digital marketing, I understand how to make videos that can be utilized in a larger marketing strategy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        [Marketing experience:] <br>
        When it comes to product and business, my videos are oriented to help you sell your product or service. 
        My experience in outdoor videography gives me a unique style and perspective, which allows me to make your product or business stand out in a
        cold and cliche marketing landscape. No matter the product or service there is always a unique and beautiful angle that can be taken at 
        showcasing it.
        <br>
        <br>
        [Specialized skills:] <br>
        All of the wild and exciting videos on the internet had to be filmed by someone. 
        Often times, when it comes to extreme videos, the videographer must be able to keep up with the athletes. 
        From hunting to rock climbing, motorsports to skiing, I have the skills to keep up with the action and capture it safely and effectively.

      <h3>Wedding</h3>
      <p>
        [Weddings] <br>
        Weddings are a special day that you will remember for the rest of your life. A good wedding 
        video can help you relive that day over and over again, without ruining the moment for everyone else. 
        I make sure to stay as out of the way as possible, allowing for a more candid and natural video. When necessary i am
        not afraid to take charge and get the shots that are needed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        [Engagements] <br>
        Engagements are often overlooked when it comes to videography. I believe that engagements are just as important as the wedding day.
        Engagement videos can present a unique challenge when it comes to maintaining secrecy for that surprise proposal. In the video below, i planned and executed a surprise proposal video with the groom beforehand. 
        We carefully planned the location and timing, and I camoflauged the camera and myself. The result was a candid beautiful and emotional video that the couple will cherish forever. 
        <br>
        <br>
        [Photos] <br>
        I also offer photography services. The style of my photography matches my videos and is perfect for engagements and weddings. 
        In the event that you need both photography and videography,
        I have a few skilled photographers that I work with, and we can offer a package deal for both photography and videography.

      <h3>Product and Business</h3>
      <p>
        [Product Videos] <br>
        Product videos have become a staple in the marketing world. They are a great way to showcase your product in a way that is engaging and informative.
        the 15-30 second videos are perfect for targeted ads and in store displays. The longer 1-3 minute videos go well on landing pages and can be used as tutorials.
        When it comes to driving a sale, a good product video can make all the difference. Short form video is, and will continue to be the dominant form of media for the foreseeable future.
        I have worked with some of the best in the industry (Full Time Filmmakers) on product videos.
        <br>
        <br>
        [Brand message videos] <br>
        Brand message videos are a great way to tell your customers who you are and what you stand for. They are a great way to connect with your customers on a personal level.
        Statistics show that customers are more likely to buy from a company that they feel a personal connection with. When it comes to building a connection, brand message videos are the starting point.
        <br>
        <br>
        [Testimonials and other business videos] <br>
        Testimonials are a great way to show potential customers that you are a trustworthy company. They work especially well when it comes to local businesses, or products that are expensive and require a lot of trust.
        Aside from testimonials, I also offer other business videos such as training videos, and event videos. Any text on a website can be accompanied by a video, and it will always be more engaging.
        Another great way to build trust and community around a business. There is a fine line to walk between relating to your customers and just being "corporate cringe." I have your best interest in mind and will be the 
        first one to tell you if a video is "cringe" and shouldnt be posted. Find out from me rather than from your comment section.
