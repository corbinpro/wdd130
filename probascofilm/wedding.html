      <h2>Weddings</h2>
      <p>Weddings are a special day that you will remember for the rest of your life. A good wedding 
        video can help you relive that day over and over again, without ruining the moment for everyone else. 
        I make sure to stay as out of the way as possible, allowing for a more candid and natural video. When necessary i am
        not afraid to take charge and get the shots that are needed.</p>

      <h2>Engagements</h2>
      <p>Engagements are often overlooked when it comes to videography. I believe that engagements are just as important as the wedding day.
        Engagement videos can present a unique challenge when it comes to maintaining secrecy for that surprise proposal. In the video below, i planned and executed a surprise proposal video with the groom beforehand. 
        We carefully planned the location and timing, and I camoflauged the camera and myself. The result was a candid beautiful and emotional video that the couple will cherish forever. </p>  
      <h2>Photos</h2>
      <p>I also offer photography services. The style of my photography matches my videos and is perfect for engagements and weddings. 
        In the event that you need both photography and videography,
        I have a few skilled photographers that I work with, and we can offer a package deal for both photography and videography.</p>
