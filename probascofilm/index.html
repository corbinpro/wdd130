      <h3>Film where nobody else will. </h3>
      <p>My name is Corbin Probasco, I am a videographer who specializes in outdoor videography.

        <h3>
            Marketing Experience
        </h3>
        <p>
        When it comes to product and business, my videos are oriented to help you sell your product or service. 
        My experience in outdoor videography gives me a unique style and perspective, which allows me to make your product or business stand out in a
        cold and cliche marketing landscape. No matter the product or service there is always a unique and beautiful angle that can be taken at 
        showcasing it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Specialized skills
        </h3>
        <p>
            All of the wild and exciting videos on the internet had to be filmed by someone. 
            Often times, when it comes to extreme videos, the videographer must be able to keep up with the athletes. 
            From hunting to rock climbing, motorsports to skiing, I have the skills to keep up with the action and capture it safely and effectively.
